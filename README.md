# Flight Delay Prediction Web Application

This is a Flask-based web application for predicting flight delays using machine learning. Users can input flight details such as month, day of the month, carrier, destination, and flight number to get a prediction on whether the flight will be delayed or not based on weather conditions.

## Features

- Predict flight delays based on weather conditions and flight details.
- Simple and intuitive web interface for users to input flight information.
- Uses a machine learning model trained on historical flight and weather data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
